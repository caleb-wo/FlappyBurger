# Overview

For this project I wanted to finally take the time to make something with Godot Game Engine. 

I've recently been very intruiged with Godot and it's taken a lot of my free time. It's such an amazing software and it suprisingly powerful and intuitive.

This is a Flappy Bird clone called Flappy Burger. It's essentially Flappy Bird, except you're a burger with lettuce wings (courtesy of my fiancé for making us Flappy Burger!).

# Development Environment

As I'm sure comes as no suprise, this project was built with Godot game engine. 
However, much of the assets and materials I found online for free (see Useful Websites). 

In fact, before I made Flappy Burger, I did a tutorial follow through, which is where all of those other random assets come from.

The programming language used here is GDScript. Godot's own scripting language.
It's very powerful and is deeply integrated with Godot's Engine. It's similar to Python and offers static and loose typing (but of course we're doing static =D). 

# Useful Websites

* [Godot Docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/); Godot's documentation was crucial for me in learning how it works and getting a grasp on the node and scene system.
* [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys) and his [2D game tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) were SO helpful. I watched it all the way through and regularly went back to it. (also where I got assets to practice with.)

* [Coding With Russ](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithRuss) was also great and I went along with his [Flappy Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f9t9eiCDAA&pp=ygURZmxhcHB5IGJpcmQgZ29kb3Q%3D) Godot demo. He's also responsible for the backgound, pipes, and other Flappy Bird assets.

# Future Work

* Add music and sound effects
* Have my fiancé make some background and pipe art.
